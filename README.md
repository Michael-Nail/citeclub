========

Cite Club is a web application that scours Wikipedia for entries that need citations, pulls them into the system, and allows users to provide citations in a game-like format.

It is currently in active developement. Running it locally is not advised, but if you choose to go ahead and do it, use Firefox, as Cite Club utilizes LESS and it will not compile locally in Chrome.

Cite the power.
